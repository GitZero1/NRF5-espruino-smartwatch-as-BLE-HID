# NRF5-espruino-smartwatch-as-BLE-HID
useless smartwatch app for fun contest entry. 

This is a quick project I am doing for fun to submit as a contest entry. 
The topic is "Odd Inputs and Peculiar Peripherals"

For my submission I took a g5 smartwatch that I got from ali express, hacked it to upload Espruino (Bangle.js) OS and then wrote an application for the watch to act as a bluetooth keyboard. This is still a work in progress.

This should work on a normal Bangle.js watch but I do not have one to test with. Maybe someone can test this and let me know :) 

How to install: 
Installing this app is very simple. all you need to do is...

1) connect your espruino watch to the web ide https://www.espruino.com/ide/#
2) upload keyboard.app.js and keyboard.info to your watch
3) disconnect from the web IDE
4) In your watch menu you should see a new app called "kb demo", lauch it. 
5) search for your watch as a new bluetooth device on your computer/phone/tablet and connect to it
6) type away!
